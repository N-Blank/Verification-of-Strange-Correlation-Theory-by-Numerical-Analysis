Verification of Strange Correlation Theory by Numerical Analysis

In this analysis, we explored several groups with time reversal symmetry or not to verify the correctness of strange correlation theory.
Within the sub folder, we verfied the degeneracy of transfer matrix of non-trivial 1D SPT state, based on which we could conclude the correctness of strange correlatoin theory.
